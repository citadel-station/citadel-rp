/* Notes on Tajara Firearms:
The Tajara history is more or less that a fuedal society with early 19th century technology was contacted by aliens with all their new dangerous ideas and cased \
munition firearm technology (way better then muskets). The resulting civil war was extremely devastating and no one won, as a result Tajara weapons technology is
extremely varied ranging from 19th century crude to modern and post modern automatics. */
